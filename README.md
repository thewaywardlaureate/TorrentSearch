# TorrentSearch
A GNU/Linux shell script that enables you to search for torrents on popular piracy sites. 

## Impetus

I find qbittorrent's search engine UI to be a bit cringe, so my smart ass decided to, with the help of a friend, make a script that lets you search for your torrents on popular websites

## Requirements

+ Librewolf (If you prefer another browser, edit the shell script to your liking)
+ Rofi
+ Common Sense
+ Hatred for subscription-based services

## Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thewaywardlaureate/TorrentSearch.git
$ cd TorrentSearch
$ chmod +777 torrentsearch.sh
$ ./torrentsearch.sh
```

## Acknowledgement

Special thanks goes out to [nbats](https://github.com/nbats) for their project, [fmhy](https://github.com/nbat/fmhy). [ChiefDinkan's](https://github.com/chiefdinkan) help was also critical to this shell script.

## End-notes

Sail the seas pirates. I also extend my hatred towards Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft and every other subscription based big brother companies. You all can rot in hell. **FUCK YOU**
